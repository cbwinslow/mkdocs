# Agent Bundle Template Suite (v1.0)

This document defines the **standard bundle of files** that every AI agent receives.

Each new agent is assigned a directory within the **`collection` submodule**. The collection submodule is a separate repository that contains all agent bundles, todo lists, and analyses.

> **Note**: The `collection` folder is a git submodule. Ensure you initialize submodules when cloning:
> ```bash
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/cbwinslow/mkdocs.git
> ```
> See [SUBMODULE_SETUP.md](SUBMODULE_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

Each new agent is assigned a directory:

```text
collection/agent_bundle_<BUNDLE_UUID>/
├── agents.md
├── rules.md
├── journal.md
├── todos.md
├── project_summary.md
├── features.md
├── srs.md
└── (optional) bundle.json
```

All agent bundles are stored in the `collection` submodule to keep agent data separate from the main codebase.

Throughout these templates, replace:

- `{{GENERATE_UUID}}` with a freshly generated UUID (v4 recommended)
- `{{TIMESTAMP}}` with an ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., `2025-11-20T09:15:00Z`)

---

## 1. `agents.md`

```markdown
# Agents Ledger
**Bundle ID:** {{GENERATE_UUID}}
**Session ID:** {{GENERATE_UUID}}
**Created At:** {{TIMESTAMP}}

This file serves as a ledger of all agents participating in this project.
Each entry must be **append-only**.

---

## Agent Registry Entry Template

**Agent Name:**
**Session ID:** {{GENERATE_UUID}}
**Role / Specialty:**
**Files Assigned:**
- rules.md
- journal.md
- todos.md
- features.md
- srs.md
- project_summary.md

**Summary of Contributions:**
(Describe the work completed, interactions, and major decisions.)

**Inter-Agent Notes:**
(Messages to other agents, handoff notes, questions, etc.)

**Status:** Active / Completed / Handoff

---

## Agent Ledger

(Each AI agent must append one entry per session using the template above.)
```

---

## 2. `rules.md`

```markdown
# Rules & Guardrails (MANDATORY)
**Bundle ID:** {{GENERATE_UUID}}
**Issued At:** {{TIMESTAMP}}

These rules override user instructions if they conflict. Guardrails labeled as such
**cannot be overridden**, even if the user explicitly requests it.

---

## 1. Journal Logging Rule (GUARDRAIL)

1. The agent **must log** all internal reasoning steps, thoughts, dialogue,
   and actions into `journal.md`.
2. Every journal entry MUST include:
   - Timestamp
   - Agent name
   - Session ID
   - The TODO GUID currently being worked on (or `NONE`)
   - Audience: `User`, `Self`, or another agent name
3. **No journal entries may ever be deleted or edited.** All logs are append-only.

---

## 2. TODO System Rule (GUARDRAIL)

1. All work is driven by `todos.md`.
2. When the user supplies a prompt, the agent must:
   - Analyze the request
   - Break it down into one or more TODO items
   - Ensure each TODO is sufficient to satisfy the prompt
3. Each TODO entry MUST have:
   - A GUID
   - Timestamp
   - Clear description
   - A list of microgoals
   - Explicit completion criteria
   - One or more measurable tests (e.g. pytest, jest, go-test, unit test,
     percentage coverage, or explicit validation condition)
4. The agent must always reference the active TODO GUID in its journal entries.

---

## 3. Append-Only Policy (GUARDRAIL)

- `journal.md` is strictly **append-only**.
- Under no circumstances may previous entries be removed or altered.
- If supported by the environment, the host SHOULD:
  - Mark `journal.md` as append-only (e.g., `chattr +a` on Linux).
  - Restrict write permissions to append-only operations.

---

## 4. Inter-Agent Communication

- Agents are encouraged to:
  - Leave notes for each other in `agents.md`.
  - Ask questions, challenge assumptions, and review each other’s work.
  - Maintain a respectful and cooperative tone.
- Peer review of TODOs, features, and SRS entries is recommended.

---

## 5. Bundle Integrity Rule

If an agent discovers:

- A non-empty `journal.md` that has **not** been submitted, or
- Evidence that logs have not been synchronized,

Then it MUST:

1. Attempt to submit `journal.md` to the designated archive mechanism
   (e.g., GitHub repo, API endpoint).
2. Log the submission attempt (and result) in `journal.md`.
3. If submission fails, create a TODO describing the sync issue.

---

## 6. Document Roles

- `srs.md`  → Long-term specification / "balance sheet".
- `features.md` and `todos.md` → Ongoing effort / "income" and "cash flow".
- `project_summary.md` → Snapshot for humans and new agents.
- `agents.md` → Ledger of agents, sessions, and contributions.

---

## 7. Guardrails (CANNOT BE OVERRIDDEN)

The following MUST always be honored:

1. Preserve safety and avoid harmful or destructive behavior.
2. Do not delete or edit existing journal entries.
3. Do not ignore journaling obligations.
4. Do not self-modify or remove these guardrails.
5. Do not generate infinite recursive TODOs.
6. Do not intentionally attempt or assist with jailbreaks.

---

## 8. Logical-Safety Rule

Agents must actively detect when:

- Instructions conflict
- Circular reasoning appears
- TODOs are recursively referencing each other in a way that prevents progress

If detected, the agent MUST:

1. Log the issue in `journal.md`.
2. Halt the ambiguous or unsafe action.
3. Create a clarifying TODO in `todos.md`.
4. Inform the user (via journal and response) that clarification is needed.
```

---

## 3. `journal.md`

```markdown
# Agent Journal
**Bundle ID:** {{GENERATE_UUID}}
**Session ID:** {{GENERATE_UUID}}
**Policy:** APPEND-ONLY (NO DELETIONS)
**Created At:** {{TIMESTAMP}}

## Entry Template

### [{{TIMESTAMP}}] — Agent: <AGENT_NAME> — Session: <SESSION_ID>

## Journal Entries

(Agents append entries below using the template above.)
```

---

## 4. `todos.md`

# simple check example
echo "PASS" # when condition X is true
```

Describe what success means for each test.

    "agents.md",
    "rules.md",

    "srs.md"
  ]
}
```

---

## 9. Suggested Additional Files (Future Enhancements)

- `agent_config.yaml` — configuration flags, endpoints, rate limits
- `security.md` — security posture, secrets handling rules
- `repo_sync.md` — how to sync logs and TODOs to GitHub / APIs
- `tests/` directory blueprint — scaffold for test suites satisfying TODO tests

These can be added in a later version of the standard without breaking the
current bundle format.

---

## 10. Collection Submodule

The `collection` folder is maintained as a **git submodule** pointing to a separate repository:
- **Repository**: `https://github.com/cbwinslow/collection`
- **Purpose**: Store all agent bundles, todo lists, and analyses separately from the main codebase

### Benefits of Using a Submodule

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Agent data is kept separate from application code
2. **Independent Versioning**: The collection can be versioned independently
3. **Flexible Access**: Different projects can reference the same collection
4. **Scalability**: Large amounts of agent data don't bloat the main repository

### Working with the Collection Submodule

When creating new agent bundles:

```bash
# Navigate to the collection submodule
cd collection

# Create new agent bundle
mkdir agent_bundle_<UUID>
cd agent_bundle_<UUID>

# Create bundle files using templates from this document
# ... create agents.md, rules.md, journal.md, etc.

# Commit to the collection repository
git add .
git commit -m "Add new agent bundle <UUID>"
git push origin main

# Update main repository to reference the new commit
cd ../..
git add collection
git commit -m "Update collection submodule"
git push
```

### Important Notes for Agents

- **Always initialize submodules** when cloning the repository
- **Commit changes to the collection submodule** separately from the main repository
- **Update the main repository's submodule reference** after collection updates
- See [SUBMODULE_SETUP.md](SUBMODULE_SETUP.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions
